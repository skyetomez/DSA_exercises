"""
Write a Python program that simulates a system that supports the func-
tions of an e-book reader. You should include methods for users of your
system to “buy” new books, view their list of purchased books, and read
their purchased books. Your system should use actual books, which have
expired copyrights and are available on the Internet, to populate your set
of available books for users of your system to “purchase” and read.
